# frensmatria
its just a simple p2p network for studying and adding multiple information.

Its not finished, for now we have to actually implement many of this things, possibly the relay will have to change.

## TODO

- [x] communication between nodes
- [x] a relay for sharing the SDP descriptor between nodes
- [x] a way of managing multiple connections
- [x] an event handler
- [ ] the db for storing the gematria
- [ ] calculating the gematria
- [ ] a web interface for interacting and sharing information
- [ ] passwords and other stuff for connecting with other nodes
- [ ] a seed node for making it easier to handle
- [ ] and nothing else
