# frensmatria
its just a simple p2p network for studying and adding multiple information.

Its not finished, for now we have to actually implement many of this things, possibly the relay will have to change.

## how to test it
just run the file `nodes/main.go`, at this moment i am working on building the website and the database so, for now you cant test anything related to the p2p stuff.
At least for now.
## TODO


- [x] communication between nodes
- [x] a relay for sharing the SDP descriptor between nodes
- [x] a way of managing multiple connections
- [x] an event handler
- [x] calculating the gematria
  - [x] synx
  - [x] Alphanumeric Qabbalah 
- [x] a web interface for interacting and sharing information
  - [x] calculate gematria
  - [x] look into recent synchs
  - [ ] a simple chat(just in case, this feature will probably be removed)
- [x] the db for storing the gematria 
- [ ] share between nodes information(events and other stuff)
- [ ] passwords and other stuff for connecting with other nodes
- [ ] a seed node for making it easier to handle
