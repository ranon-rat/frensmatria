# frensmatria
its just a simple p2p network for studying and adding multiple information.

Its not finished, for now we have to actually implement many of this things, possibly the relay will have to change.

## TODO

[*] communication between nodes
[*] a relay for sharing the SDP descriptor between nodes
[*] a way of managing multiple connections
[*] an event handler
[] the db for storing the gematria
[] calculating the gematria
[] a web interface for interacting and sharing information
[] passwords and other stuff for connecting with other nodes
[] a seed node for making it easier to handle
[] and nothing else
