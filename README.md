# Frensmatria

Welcome to **Frensmatria** â€“ an innovative P2P network designed for exploring and expanding gematria knowledge!

Currently, it's in the development phase. I have many exciting features to implement, and some aspects of the relay may undergo changes.

## How to Test It

To get started, simply run the file `nodes/main.go`. At this stage, I'm focusing on building the website and database, so P2P functionalities aren't ready for testing yet.
