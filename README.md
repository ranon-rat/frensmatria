# Frensmatria

Welcome to **Frensmatria** â€“ a peer-to-peer (P2P) network dedicated to exploring gematria knowledge through collaborative nodes and a unified private relay system.

Currently in development

## Getting Started

### Starting the P2P Service

To begin using the P2P tools, run the `main.go` file located in the `relay` folder.

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Commands and Configuration

Here are the main parameters you can use to customize the execution:

- **relay**: Specifies the address of the relay to connect to. The default setting is `localhost:9090`.
- **-update**: Controls whether the database should be updated when the service starts. By default it will not update.
- **http-server** it will start an http server at the port that you defined
- **username** it will define a username. By default it will just generate a random username.
#### Example Usage

```bash
go run main.go -relay "localhost:9090"   -update -http-server 6969
```

This example runs the service on `localhost` at port 6969, using the generated ID and updating the database at startup.

## Key Features

- **Node Communication**: Enables nodes to connect and share information.
- **SDP Relay System**: Facilitates sharing of SDP descriptors for P2P connectivity.
- **Connection Management**: Supports multiple connections across the network.
- **Event Handling**: Manages real-time updates and communication events.
- **Gematria Calculations**:
  - Synx
  - Alphanumeric Qabbalah
- **Web Interface**:
  - Interactive gematria calculator
  - Recent results display
- **Database Integration**: Stores gematria results for future access.
- **Node Information Sharing**: Allows for the exchange of events and data across nodes.

## Roadmap

Here's a list of completed and planned features:

- [x] **Node Communication**
- [x] **Relay for SDP Sharing**
- [x] **Multi-Connection Management**
- [x] **Event Handler**
- [x] **Gematria Calculations** (Synx and Alphanumeric Qabbalah)
- [x] **Web Interface** (for calculating and viewing gematria results)
