# frensmatria
its just a simple p2p network for studying and adding multiple information.

Its not finished, for now we have to actually implement many of this things, possibly the relay will have to change.

## TODO

- [x] communication between nodes
- [x] a relay for sharing the SDP descriptor between nodes
- [x] a way of managing multiple connections
- [x] an event handler
- [ ] the db for storing the gematria 
- [x] calculating the gematria
  - [x] simple gematria
  - [ ] idk which ones i should add next probably will be adding them as the community wants
- [x] a web interface for interacting and sharing information
  - [x] calculate gematria(simple)
  - [ ] look into recent synchs
  - [ ] a simple chat(just in case, this feature will probably be removed)
- [ ] passwords and other stuff for connecting with other nodes
- [ ] a seed node for making it easier to handle
